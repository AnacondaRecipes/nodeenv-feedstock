  description: |
    nodeenv (node.js virtual environment) is a tool to create isolated node.js environments.
    It creates an environment that has its own installation directories, that doesn't share libraries with other node.js virtual environments.
    Also new environment can be integrated with environment which was built by virtualenv (python).
